LGBM (SHAP values):
RMSE:18.79
Positive contributors: CEO, CTO, CFO, OIL, FINANCE, ENGINEERING
Features with negative influence: JANITOR, EDUCATION, SERVICE, JUNIOR
Experience and location (yearsExperience, milesFromMetropolis) have minor contributions, with slight negative impacts in SHAP analysis.

Linear Regression (coefficients):
RMSE:19.59
Positive coefficients align with higher-level positions and specialized degrees: jobType_CEO, degree_DOCTORAL, industry_OIL, industry_FINANCE.
Negative coefficients are associated with lower-level positions and less advanced education: jobType_JANITOR, degree_NONE, industry_EDUCATION.

Interpretation
LGBM outperforms Linear Regression, reducing prediction error by approximately 0.8 RMSE points. 
This improvement demonstrates the advantage of tree-based models in capturing nonlinear relationships and interactions among features.
Both models agree that higher-level positions and specialized degrees contribute positively, while lower-level positions and less advanced education has significantly low pay.
Company-specific identifiers have small but measurable effects.
LGBM captures nonlinear effects and interactions that Linear Regression cannot, explaining its better RMSE performance.
