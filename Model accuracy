Residual standard error: 19.61 on 999910 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7435,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.7435 
F-statistic: 3.257e+04 on 89 and 999910 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
74.35% of the data can be described by the linear model. Since the p value is less than .05. We reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the added variables 
do not improve the model.
